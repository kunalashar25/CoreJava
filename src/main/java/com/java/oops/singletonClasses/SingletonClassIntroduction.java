	// 1. For any Java class if we're allowed to create only one object then such type of class is called Singleton
	// class.

	// Example: Runtime, BusinessDeligate, ServiceLocator, etc

	/**
	 * Advantage of Singleton Class
	 **/
	// 1. If several people have same requirement then it is not recommended to create separate object for every
	// requirement.

	// 2. We have to create only one object and we can reuse same object for every similar requirement so that
	// performance and memory utilization will be improved.

	// 3. This is the central idea of Singleton classes.

	// Example: Only one runtime object is created and and r1,r2,r3 are referring to the same object.
	Runtime r1 = Runtime.getRuntime();
	Runtime r2 = Runtime.getRuntime();
	Runtime r3 = Runtime.getRuntime();

	/**
	 * How to create Singleton Classes?
	 **/

	// We can create our own singleton classes for this we have to use private constructor and private static
	// variable and public factory method.

	// Approach 1
	private static SingletonClassIntroduction s1 = new SingletonClassIntroduction();

	private SingletonClassIntroduction() {

	}

	public static SingletonClassIntroduction getSingletonClass() {
		return s1;
	}

	// Note: Runtime class is internally implemented by using this approach.
}

// Approach 2
class Singleton {
	private static Singleton s = null;

	private Singleton() {

	}

	public static Singleton getSingletonClass() {
		if (s == null) {
			s = new Singleton();
		}
		return s;
	}
}

// At any point of time for above class we can create only one object. Hence, above class is Singleton Class.

// Q: Class is not final but we're not allowed to create child classes. How is it possible?
// Ans: By declaring every constructor as private we can restrict child class creation.

class Parent {
	private Parent() {

	}
}

class Child extends Parent {
	// it is impossible to create child class for Parent class.
}
