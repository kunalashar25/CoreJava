	// 1. For every component a clear well-defined functionality is defined then that component is said to be follow
	// high-cohesion.

	// 2. High Cohesion is always a good programming practice because it has several advantages:
	// i. Without affecting remaining components we can modify any component. Hence, enhancement will become easy.
	// ii. It promotes reusability of the code. Where ever validation is required, we can reuse same code.
	// iii. It improves maintainability of the application.

	// Note: Loosely Coupling and High Cohesion are good programming practices.
