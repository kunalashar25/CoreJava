		// time of object destruction. Hence, the scope of instance variable is same as
		// the scope of object.

		// Instance variable will be stored in the heap memory as part of object.

		// we can't access instance variable directly from static area but we can access
		// by using object reference.

		// main is a static method and static method is not related to the object and
		// instance variable is related to a object. Hence we cannot access instance
		// variable without object reference.

		// field x
