	// inner classes are called static nested classes).

	// variables a single copy will be created at class level and shared by every object of that class.

	// 2. static int x = 10;
	// 3. public void m1() {System.out.println(x);}
	// 4. public static void m1() {System.out.println(x);}

	// Within the same class, which of the declaration we can take simultaneously:
	// A. 1 and 3 >> Valid
	// B. 1 and 4 >> Invalid (CE: non static variable a cannot be referenced from a static context)
	// C. 2 and 3 >> Valid
	// D. 2 and 4 >> Valid

	// Note:
	// 1. We cannot have instance and static variable with same name else we'll get compile time error as variable x is
	// already defined in class StaticVariable1

	// 2. We cannot have instance and static method with same name else we'll get compile time error as m1() is already
	// defined in class StaticVariable1
