		sum(new int[]{10, 20, 30});

		// While creating anonymous array we can't specify the size other wise
		// we'll get compile time error. See below:

		// sum(new int[3] { 10, 20, 30 }); CE: Cannot define dimension
		// expressions when an array initializer is provided

	// we can also create multi-dimensional anonymous arrays.
	// new int[][] {{10,20},{30,40,50}};

	// Based on our requirement we can give the name for anonymous array then it
	// is no longer anonymous.
	int[] x = new int[]{10, 20, 30};

	// In the above example just to call some method we required an array but
	// after completing some method call we're not using that array anymore
