	/** Arrays Overview **/
	// 1. An Array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.

	// 2. The main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values by using single variable so that readability
	// of the code will be improved.

	/** Limitations of Arrays **/
	// 1. Arrays are fixed in size i.e once we create an array there is no way to increase or decrease array size based
	// on our requirement. Due to this, to use arrays concept we must know the data size in advance which is not
	// possible in all the cases.

	// 2. Array can hold only homogeneous data type elements.

	// 3. Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure and hence ready made method support is
	// not available. For every requirement, we have to write the code explicitly which increases complexity of the
	// programming.

	// 4. To overcome above problems of arrays we should go for collections concept.

	/** Collection Introduction **/
	// 1. Collections are growable in nature i.e. based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size.

	// 2. Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.

	// 3. Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure. Hence, for every requirement
	// ready made method support is available. Being a programmer we're responsible to use those methods and we're not
	// responsible to implement those methods.

	// Refer Arrays_vs_Collections.PNG

	// If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collection.

	/** Collection framework **/
	// It contains several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as single
	// entity.
